# Gridland metro

The city of Gridland is represented as an n√óm matrix where the rows are numbered from 1 to n and the columns are numbered from 1 to m.

Gridland has a network of train tracks that always run in straight horizontal lines along a row. In other words, the start and end points of a train track are (r,c1) and (r,c2), where r represents the row number, c1 represents the starting column, and c2 represents the ending column of the train track.
